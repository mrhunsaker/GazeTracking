## Security Best Practices

To ensure the security of your deployment, please follow these best practices:

- **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly update your dependencies to the latest versions to ensure you have the latest security patches.
- **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
- **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive information such as API keys and database credentials in environment variables, not in your codebase.
- **Access Control**: Implement proper access control mechanisms to restrict access to sensitive parts of your application.
- **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular security audits and code reviews to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities.
