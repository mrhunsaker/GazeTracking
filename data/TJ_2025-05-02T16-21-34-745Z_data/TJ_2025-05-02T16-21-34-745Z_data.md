### Shapiro-Wilk Test for Normality


This test checks whether the data follows a normal distribution. It returns a test statistic and a p-value. A p-value less than 0.05 indicates that the data significantly deviates from a normal distribution.

### Executive Summary

This analysis examined the gaze data across different trial types to determine if there were significant differences in gaze behavior. The Shapiro-Wilk test for normality indicated that the target gaze data did not follow a normal distribution (p-value: <span style="color:red">0.000000</span>), while the non-target gaze data did not follow a normal distribution (p-value: <span style="color:red">0.000000</span>). Levene's test for homoscedasticity showed that the variances between target and non-target gaze data were equal (p-value: 0.723513).

The Wilcoxon signed-rank test revealed that the target gaze percentage was not significantly greater than 33% (p-value: 0.859551). Additionally, the Wilcoxon test comparing target and non-target gaze percentages indicated that there was no significant difference between the two conditions (p-value: 0.878750).

The independent t-test comparing target gaze percentages between Trial Type 1 and Trial Type 2 showed that there was no significant difference between the two trial types (p-value: 0.727173). Finally, the one-way ANOVA test indicated that the target gaze percentages across different trial types were not significantly different (p-value: 0.081057).

Overall, these results provide insights into the gaze behavior across different trial types, highlighting significant differences where applicable.
