### Shapiro-Wilk Test for Normality
This test checks whether the data follows a normal distribution. It returns a test statistic and a p-value. A p-value less than 0.05 indicates that the data significantly deviates from a normal distribution.

| Measure         | W Statistic        | p-value                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------- |

| Non-Target Gaze | 0.8926877379417419 | <span style="color:red">0.001179</span> |
### Levene's Test for Homoscedasticity
This test checks whether the data has equal variances. It returns a test statistic and a p-value. A p-value less than 0.05 indicates that the data significantly deviates from equal variances.

| W Statistic        | p-value                                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| 46.833424720571074 | <span style="color:red">0.000000</span> |
### Wilcoxon Test (One-Sided; Target >= 33%)
This test checks whether the target gaze percentage is significantly greater than 33%. It returns a test statistic and a p-value. A p-value less than 0.05 indicates that the target gaze percentage is significantly greater than 33%. To compare target gaze percentages between two conditions (e.g., target vs. non-target, or trial type 1 vs. trial type 2). It returns a test statistic and a p-value. A p-value less than 0.05 indicates a significant difference between the groups.

| W Statistic | p-value  |
| ----------- | -------- |
| 494.0       | 0.073331 |
### Wilcoxon Test (Two-Sided; Target vs Non-Target)
This test checks whether the target gaze percentage is significantly different from the non-target gaze percentage. It returns a test statistic and a p-value. A p-value less than 0.05 indicates a significant difference between the target and non-target gaze percentages.

| W Statistic | p-value                                 |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 143.0       | <span style="color:red">0.000567</span> |
**Difference**: 26.17
### T-Test (Two-Sided; Target vs Non-Target)
This test checks whether the target gaze percentage is significantly different from the non-target gaze percentage. It returns a test statistic and a p-value. A p-value less than 0.05 indicates a significant difference between the target and non-target gaze percentages.

| T-Statistic       | Degrees of Freedom | p-value                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| 4.928370301095209 | 78                 | <span style="color:red">0.000005</span> |
**Difference**: 26.17
### ANOVA (Target Gaze Percentages across Trial Types)
This test checks whether the target gaze percentages are significantly different across trial types. It returns a test statistic and a p-value. A p-value less than 0.05 indicates a significant difference between the groups.

| F-Statistic       | Degrees of Freedom (Between) | Degrees of Freedom (Within) | p-value                                 |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 8.450577897690648 | 1                            | 38                          | <span style="color:red">0.006060</span> |

### Executive Summary

This analysis examined the gaze data across different trial types to determine if there were significant differences in gaze behavior. The Shapiro-Wilk test for normality indicated that the target gaze data did not follow a normal distribution (p-value: <span style="color:red">0.008243</span>), while the non-target gaze data did not follow a normal distribution (p-value: <span style="color:red">0.001179</span>). Levene's test for homoscedasticity showed that the variances between target and non-target gaze data were not equal (p-value: <span style="color:red">0.000000</span>).

The Wilcoxon signed-rank test revealed that the target gaze percentage was not significantly greater than 33% (p-value: 0.073331). Additionally, the Wilcoxon test comparing target and non-target gaze percentages indicated that there was a significant difference between the two conditions (p-value: <span style="color:red">0.000567</span>).

The independent t-test comparing target gaze percentages between Trial Type 1 and Trial Type 2 showed that there was a significant difference between the two trial types (p-value: <span style="color:red">0.000005</span>). Finally, the one-way ANOVA test indicated that the target gaze percentages across different trial types were significantly different (p-value: <span style="color:red">0.006060</span>).

Overall, these results provide insights into the gaze behavior across different trial types, highlighting significant differences where applicable.
